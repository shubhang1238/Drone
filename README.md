# Green belt  irrigation drone 
*plants are planted on the road side highway some are irrigated some are left behind we developed a drone whih can detect the moisture and provide the water to the plants 
As well i used CIFAR-19 so that drone does't recognise the vehicles & living being* <br>
We got the motivation from the automation lab visit where drones and robots were displayed. We considered that robotics and automation holds a lot of scope in the coming future so we came up with this idea. The greenbelt region in the cities is the only way to manage balance of ecosystem so if we won't properly irrigate them then ecosystem will become unbalanced and there will be serious repercussions. Drones are very expensive so we are not making it for only a single purpose, in this COVID-19 Phase it can be used for sanitization purpose as well. <br>
*We have tested the performance of our system both in field operationally and with several videos. 6 shows the detections generated by our approach and several conventional detection algorithms, which produce high amount of false alarms due to background. In this document, we present the results for detection performance compared to cascaded HAAR detector*
